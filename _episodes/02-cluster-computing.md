An example lesson for cluster computing can be found here: <a href="https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-shell/">Introduction to using the shell in High-Performance Computing</a>

For this particular lesson, the contents need to be adapted for the use of SURFsara systems. SURFsara has two main cluster facilities: the national supercomputer Cartesius and the national compute cluster Lisa. As basic information, the way to access SURFsara via SSH using the following commands:

```
ssh yourUsername@cartesius.surfsara.nl    # access to Cartesius

ssh yourUsername@lisa.surfsara.nl    # access to Lisa
```
{: .language-bash}

Further information and also a general overview on how to use SURFsara facilities can be found in the <a href="https://userinfo.surfsara.nl">User Info pages of SURFsara</a>, and selecting there the corresponding system (either <a href="https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius/">Cartesius</a> or <a href="https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa/">Lisa</a>).
